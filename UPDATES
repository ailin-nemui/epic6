*** News 02/17/2024 [3018] -- Mouse support (click-to-focus, scrolling)
	If you /SET MOUSE ON and if your terminal emulator cooperates,
	EPIC will support:
	  1. Clicking on a window will switch to that window
	  2. Using the scrollwheel will scroll the _current input window_
	When mouse support is turned on, other things you do with your 
	mouse -- like selecting text -- will probably not work.  Some 
	emulators will let you do that if you're holding the shift key.
	I haven't tested this at all with multiple screens.

*** News 12/12/2024 [3008] -- New function $token(<lval> <string>) 
	By special request of fusion!

	Usage: 	$token(<lval> <string>)
	<lval> refers to a variable name that has some value in it.

	The value in $<lval> is divided into three parts:
	  1. The part before <string>
	  2. The part that is exactly <string>
	  3. The part that comes after <string>

	When <string> is found in $<lval>:
		The return function is the first part
		$<lval> is assigned to the third part
	When <string> is not found in $<lval>
		The return value is the value of $<lval>
		$<lval> is removed

	In all cases, spaces are ordinary characters.

*** News 08/26/2024 -- EPIC6 forked from EPIC5
	A new journey awaits!
