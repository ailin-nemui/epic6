EPIC6-0.0.1

*** News 05/12/2025 -- New function $ecdsatool()
	This is based on/forked from the "ecdsatool" and libecdsa projects.

	$ecdsatool(keygen file.pem)
		Create a new keypair and save it to "file.pem".
		The file will be created with permissions 0400.
		If for any reason it can't be created securely,
		it won't be created at all.
		The return value is the base64 encoded public key

	$ecdsatool(pubkey file.pem)
		Output the public key for 'file.pem'
		The file must have permissions 0400.  
		If it has insecure permissions, it won't be loaded.
		The return value is the base64 encoded public key

	$ecdsatool(sign file.pem base64-challenge)
		Sign the <base64-challenge> with the private key in file.pem.
		The file must have permissions 0400.  
		If it has insecure permissions, it won't be used.
		The return value is the base64 encoded signed challenge

	Maybe in the future we will support 'verify', but I need to find
	a use case for that first.

*** News 05/12/2025 -- Improvements to vhost handling
	Vhost handling used to be fully blocking.  Now it blocks only when 
	(1) You are using a hostname, not an IP address, and
	(2) It is the first time you're using that vhost.
	After you use a vhost, it is cached, and doesn't block again.
	It will never block if you use an IP address.

*** News 04/30/2025 -- Unix Domain Sockets support sunset
	ircII has traditionally supported unix domain sockets to connect to
	servers, as in  /server /tmp/.ircd/6667.  I bet you didn't even know
	that.  I bet I was the only one who ever even used that.

*** News 04/30/2025 -- ^S is no longer bound to TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN by default
	TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN toggles "hold mode" which most people do not 
	want to use anyways.  It's one of those things that everyone turns
	off, so why not just make it opt-in instead of opt-out?

*** News 04/10/2025 -- $json_implode() now defaults to "compact:true"
	The $json_implode() function takes an assign tree root
	and converts everything underneath it into a json doc.
	Previously, the default was "compact:false" which gave you 
	a multi-string line.  That's wonderful for /echo but kind of
	stinks if you want to write it to a file.  The default is
	now to return it in one line -- suitable for /msg'ing or
	writing or whatever.  

	You can still use kwargs to turn compact:false if you want.
		/echo $json_implode({"root":"q", "compact":false})

*** News 04/10/2025 -- New server state, POLICY
	There is a new server state POLICY between "RECONNECT" and "DNS".
	Just for completeness, here are the states in order
		CREATED		RECONNECT	POLICY
		DNS		CONNECTING	SSL_CONNECTING
		REGISTERING	SYNCING		ACTIVE
		EOF		ERROR		CLOSING
		CLOSED		DELETED
	These states reflect the progress of a connection to the server
	from the moment it is born through a connection until it is closed

	The POLICY state is where you would want to modify a server's 
	description information _after_ the user asks to connect to it
	but _before_ anything happens.  This could be useful for things
	like changing the hostname, or changing the port or IRC-SSL things,
	or supplying a password, you know, I haven't decided what-all yet.

*** News 03/08/2025 -- A note about EPIC6
	I dislike software that seems to grow new features without any
	sense of purpose; and the bloat makes it difficult to do the
	core things you need to do.  One cause of this problem is 
	cognitive overload.  The more features software has, the harder
	it is to keep everything focused.

	For each new generation of EPIC, features get sunset whose
	utility served us well 30 years ago, but are not so useful now.
	By removing such features, it is possible to add new features 
	without things getting "bloated"

	In EPIC6, the following features have been removed and are not 
	expected to reteurn.  If you strongly disagree with the retirement 
	of these features, please contact us and we can talk about it!
		C90-only environs	Shebang support
		/REDIRECT and /FLUSH	/QUEUE
		CPU Saver		Flood Control
		Pthreads/poll/kqueue/etc
		Ruby			Perl 		
		External cryptography	Blowfish, FiSH, SED, CAST5
		ircII's original math parser
		Shift-JIS		termcap-only

	Also, some features were hardcoded (written in C) but are now
	implemented as a script:
		Mail checking		/NOTIFY

	Some features were hardcoded but are coming back in the future
		E2E encryption		ignore
		$dbmctl() 		/DCC

	Because of these removals, EPIC6 has already sprouted these
	exciting new features!
		Unlimited input line (with message breaking)
		Mouse support (click-to-focus, scrollwheel)
		SQLite support

	Even more things are coming down the pipeline!

*** News 02/17/2025 [3018] -- Mouse support (click-to-focus, scrolling)
	If you /SET MOUSE ON and if your terminal emulator cooperates,
	EPIC will support:
	  1. Clicking on a window will switch to that window
	  2. Using the scrollwheel will scroll the _current input window_
	When mouse support is turned on, other things you do with your 
	mouse -- like selecting text -- will probably not work.  Some 
	emulators will let you do that if you're holding the shift key.
	I haven't tested this at all with multiple screens.

*** News 12/12/2024 [3008] -- New function $token(<lval> <string>) 
	By special request of fusion!

	Usage: 	$token(<lval> <string>)
	<lval> refers to a variable name that has some value in it.

	The value in $<lval> is divided into three parts:
	  1. The part before <string>
	  2. The part that is exactly <string>
	  3. The part that comes after <string>

	When <string> is found in $<lval>:
		The return function is the first part
		$<lval> is assigned to the third part
	When <string> is not found in $<lval>
		The return value is the value of $<lval>
		$<lval> is removed

	In all cases, spaces are ordinary characters.

*** News 08/26/2024 -- EPIC6 forked from EPIC5
	A new journey awaits!
