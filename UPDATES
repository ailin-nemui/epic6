*** News 12/12/2024 [3008] -- New function $token(<lval> <string>) 
	By special request of fusion!

	Usage: 	$token(<lval> <string>)
	<lval> refers to a variable name that has some value in it.

	The value in $<lval> is divided into three parts:
	  1. The part before <string>
	  2. The part that is exactly <string>
	  3. The part that comes after <string>

	When <string> is found in $<lval>:
		The return function is the first part
		$<lval> is assigned to the third part
	When <string> is not found in $<lval>
		The return value is the value of $<lval>
		$<lval> is removed

	In all cases, spaces are ordinary characters.

*** News 08/26/2024 -- EPIC6 forked from EPIC5
	A new journey awaits!
