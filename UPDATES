EPIC6-0.0.1

*** News 03/08/2025 -- A note about EPIC6
	I dislike software that seems to grow new features without any
	sense of purpose; and the bloat makes it difficult to do the
	core things you need to do.  One cause of this problem is 
	cognitive overload.  The more features software has, the harder
	it is to keep everything focused.

	For each new generation of EPIC, features get sunset whose
	utility served us well 30 years ago, but are not so useful now.
	By removing such features, it is possible to add new features 
	without things getting "bloated"

	In EPIC6, the following features have been removed and are not 
	expected to reteurn.  If you strongly disagree with the retirement 
	of these features, please contact us and we can talk about it!
		C90-only environs	Shebang support
		/REDIRECT and /FLUSH	/QUEUE
		CPU Saver		Flood Control
		Pthreads/poll/kqueue/etc
		Ruby			Perl 		
		External cryptography	Blowfish, FiSH, SED, CAST5
		ircII's original math parser
		Shift-JIS		termcap-only

	Also, some features were hardcoded (written in C) but are now
	implemented as a script:
		Mail checking		/NOTIFY

	Some features were hardcoded but are coming back in the future
		E2E encryption		ignore
		$dbmctl() 		/DCC

	Because of these removals, EPIC6 has already sprouted these
	exciting new features!
		Unlimited input line (with message breaking)
		Mouse support (click-to-focus, scrollwheel)
		SQLite support

	Even more things are coming down the pipeline!

*** News 02/17/2025 [3018] -- Mouse support (click-to-focus, scrolling)
	If you /SET MOUSE ON and if your terminal emulator cooperates,
	EPIC will support:
	  1. Clicking on a window will switch to that window
	  2. Using the scrollwheel will scroll the _current input window_
	When mouse support is turned on, other things you do with your 
	mouse -- like selecting text -- will probably not work.  Some 
	emulators will let you do that if you're holding the shift key.
	I haven't tested this at all with multiple screens.

*** News 12/12/2024 [3008] -- New function $token(<lval> <string>) 
	By special request of fusion!

	Usage: 	$token(<lval> <string>)
	<lval> refers to a variable name that has some value in it.

	The value in $<lval> is divided into three parts:
	  1. The part before <string>
	  2. The part that is exactly <string>
	  3. The part that comes after <string>

	When <string> is found in $<lval>:
		The return function is the first part
		$<lval> is assigned to the third part
	When <string> is not found in $<lval>
		The return value is the value of $<lval>
		$<lval> is removed

	In all cases, spaces are ordinary characters.

*** News 08/26/2024 -- EPIC6 forked from EPIC5
	A new journey awaits!
