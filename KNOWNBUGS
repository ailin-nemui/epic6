EPIC6 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

The philosophy of EPIC6 is to make the UX better.  
Many things have UX that is obtuse and so people don't use features.
Although things may disappear in the near term, they will be
reimagined and brought back in a better form later.

"Make the complicated simple
 Reduce Clutter
 Focus on what people actually want to do"

Things to remove
=================
*our glob (globi) - Not sure if appropriate
*queue		  - Easily scriptable
*pthreads, etc	  - Just use select
*our SHA2	  - We can get this from openssl
our sdbm (dbmctl) - Use a modern key-value store (sqlite)
ruby		  - Incomplete/unloved
perl		  - Incomplete/unloved
*All encryption but AES - Obsolete/insecure

Things to remove, but bring back
================================
*e2e encryption	  - Targeting
*ignore		  - Targeting
*flood control	  - Incomplete/unloved
*mail checking     - Scriptable
*notify		  - Scriptable/unloved

Things to support
=================
CAP/SASL/ZNC
Emojis (incl ZWJ)
Unlimited input line
Mouse support
*PBKDF
CHACHA20
*Auto-ssl for ssl ports
*sqlite
Arena allocation
*tcgetwinsize() instead of ioctl()

Actual bugs
================
* /SET NEW_SERVER_LASTLOG_LEVEL does not work properly because it doesn't check window servers.
