EPIC6 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

The philosophy of EPIC6 is to make the UX better.  
Many things have UX that is obtuse and so people don't use features.
Although things may disappear in the near term, they will be
reimagined and brought back in a better form later.

"Make the complicated simple
 Reduce Clutter
 Focus on what people actually want to do"

Things to remove
=================
*our glob (globi)  - Not sure if appropriate
*queue		  - Easily scriptable
*pthreads, etc	  - Just use select
our SHA2	  - We can get this from openssl
our sdbm (dbmctl) - Use a modern key-value store
ruby		  - Incomplete/unloved
perl		  - Incomplete/unloved
All encryption but AES - Obsolete/insecure
strlcpy		  - Just use snprintf

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Sunset most of docs/ and other ancient files
* Sunset /queue (and queue.c)
* Sunset $globi() (and glob.c)
* Sunset support for pre-wiki help files in script/
* Sunset I/O disciplines other than select()
* This means we can sunset ./configure --with-multiplex
* This means we can sunset pthreads
* This means we can sunset pthreads-with-openssl locking
* Reset $info(o), since most flags are mandatory (see UPDATES)
