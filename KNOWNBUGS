EPIC6 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

The philosophy of EPIC6 is to make the UX better.  
Many things have UX that is obtuse and so people don't use features.
Although things may disappear in the near term, they will be
reimagined and brought back in a better form later.

"Make the complicated simple
 Reduce Clutter
 Focus on what people actually want to do"
